#RCMud is a C and C++ mud written from Jobo's Socketmud. It's main
reason is to better learn the c/c++ language and also to try and make
a completely new codebase from scratch. Even though it's not entirely
from scratch being barebones, little or nothing in it except for a socket
connect controll and command interpreter built in. It can be widely built upon.
